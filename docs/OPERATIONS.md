# Host operational contract

## State ownership

The deployable Host state root contains:

```text
host.sqlite3   schema v3 event journal, Task projection, leases, and CAS validation cache
objects/       immutable content-addressed objects
receipts/      operational and live-scenario receipts
backups/       optional operator-selected backup destinations
```

Schema evolution is explicit:

- v1 → v2 removes the unowned `task_nodes`, `task_edges`, `runtime_links`, and `wakeups` tables. Migration proceeds only when all four tables are empty; populated legacy tables fail closed. The source database is retained as `host.sqlite3.pre-schema-v2.sqlite3`.
- v2 → v3 adds `object_validation`, which binds a previously SHA-256-verified CAS object to its device, inode, length, modification time, change time, and mode. The source database is retained as `host.sqlite3.pre-schema-v3.sqlite3`.

A v1 database advances through both migrations in order and records both entries in `schema_migrations`.

## CAS validation modes

Normal Host startup uses cached validation:

1. missing objects fail immediately;
2. an unchanged file identity reuses the last successful full decode and SHA-256 result;
3. any ordinary write, replacement, truncation, metadata change, or cache miss forces a full decode and SHA-256 check;
4. every materialized Task head is still read and fully verified while rebuilding its projection.

This cache is scoped to the trusted-local filesystem threat model. `ordivon-host doctor` always performs full byte validation of every referenced CAS object, covering bit rot or offline block-level changes that may not be represented by normal file metadata transitions.

## Configuration

The default config path is `/etc/ordivon/host.toml`:

```toml
[state]
root = "/var/lib/ordivon/host"
receipt_root = "/var/lib/ordivon/host/receipts"

[runtime]
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8897/mcp"
token_file = "/etc/ordivon/runtime-mcp.token"
timeout_seconds = 45.0
max_response_bytes = 2097152

[providers]
codex_executable = "codex"
hermes_executable = "hermes"
timeout_seconds = 180
```

`ORDIVON_HOST_STATE_ROOT`, `ORDIVON_HOST_RECEIPT_ROOT`, `ORDIVON_MCP_ENDPOINT`, and `ORDIVON_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE` may override non-secret configuration. The bearer token itself is read from `token_file`; the CLI exposes no token argument.

## CLI

```text
ordivon-host init
ordivon-host inspect
ordivon-host config show
ordivon-host task list [--state STATE] [--limit N]
ordivon-host task show TASK_ID
ordivon-host doctor [--runtime]
ordivon-host backup DESTINATION
ordivon-host verify-backup BACKUP
ordivon-host restore BACKUP [--replace]
ordivon-host gc plan
```

Only `init` creates a missing state root. Read and backup commands reject an absent `host.sqlite3`. `gc plan` is read-only and never deletes objects.

## Backup and restore

A backup is a directory containing:

- a SQLite online backup;
- every CAS object referenced by that database;
- a manifest with exact file digests, object metadata, schema version, and migration history.

Backup verification is full and read-only: it disables validation-cache writes so repeated verification cannot alter a manifest-covered database. Restore verifies all file digests, opens the restored state under full Host invariants, and then atomically renames the verified temporary state into place. `--replace` preserves the old state root under a timestamped `.previous-*` path.

## Doctor

The local doctor checks SQLite integrity, schema compatibility, Journal invariants, full CAS content integrity, orphan objects, and lease state. `--runtime` additionally loads the token from its file and performs MCP initialization.
